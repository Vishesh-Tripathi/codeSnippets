Template 1: Sliding Window (Shrinkable)
The best template I've found so far:

int i = 0, j = 0, ans = 0;
for (; j < N; ++j) {
    // CODE: use A[j] to update state which might make the window invalid
    for (; invalid(); ++i) { // when invalid, keep shrinking the left edge until it's valid again
        // CODE: update state using A[i]
    }
    ans = max(ans, j - i + 1); // the window [i, j] is the maximum window we've found thus far
}
return ans;

Essentially, we want to keep the window valid at the end of each outer for loop.

Template 2: Sliding Window (Non-shrinkable)

int i = 0, j = 0;
for (; j < N; ++j) {
    // CODE: use A[j] to update state which might make the window invalid
    if (invalid()) { // Increment the left edge ONLY when the window is invalid. In this way, the window GROWs when it's valid, and SHIFTs when it's invalid
        // CODE: update state using A[i]
        ++i;
    }
    // after `++j` in the for loop, this window `[i, j)` of length `j - i` MIGHT be valid.
}
return j - i; // There must be a maximum window of size `j - i`.

Essentially, we GROW the window when it's valid, and SHIFT the window when it's invalid.

Note that there is only a SINGLE for loop now!
